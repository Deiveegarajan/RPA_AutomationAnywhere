  It  is  the  largest  and  most  popular  general  reference  work  on  the  World  Wide  Web,[6][7][8]  and  is  one  of  the  20  most  popular  websites  ranked  by  Alexa,  as  of  March  2020.[9]  It  features  exclusively  free  content  and  no  commercial  ads,  and  is  owned  and  supported  by  the  Wikimedia  Foundation,  a  non-profit  organization  funded  primarily  through  donations.[10][11][12][13]

Wikipedia  was  launched  on  January  15,  2001,  by  Jimmy  Wales  and  Larry  Sanger.[14]  Sanger  coined  its  name,[15][16]  as  a  portmanteau  of  "wiki"  (the  Hawaiian  word  for  "quick")[17]  and  "encyclopedia".  Initially  an  English-language  encyclopedia,  versions  of  Wikipedia  in  other  languages  were  quickly  developed.  With  6.1  million  articles,  the  English  Wikipedia  is  the  largest  of  the  more  than  300  Wikipedia  encyclopedias.  Overall,  Wikipedia  comprises  more  than  53  million  articles[18]  attracting  1.5  billion  unique  visitors  per  month.[19][20]

In  2005,  Nature  published  a  peer  review  comparing  42  hard  science  articles  from  Encyclopædia  Britannica  and  Wikipedia  and  found  that  Wikipedia's  level  of  accuracy  approached  that  of  Britannica,[21]  although  critics  suggested  that  it  might  not  have  fared  so  well  in  a  similar  study  of  a  random  sampling  of  all  articles  or  one  focused  on  social  science  or  contentious  social  issues.[22][23]  The  following  year,  Time  magazine  stated  that  the  open-door  policy  of  allowing  anyone  to  edit  had  made  Wikipedia  the  biggest  and  possibly  the  best  encyclopedia  in  the  world,  and  was  a  testament  to  the  vision  of  Jimmy  Wales.[24]
